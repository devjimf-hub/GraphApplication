# Social Network Graph Application

## Introduction
The **Social Network Graph Application** is a console-based Java program that simulates a social network. It allows users to create a virtual network of people, establish friendships, view connections, and even suggest new friendships based on existing relationships. This application models real-world relationships using graph data structures, making it a practical example of how computer science concepts apply in everyday scenarios.

## Features
The application includes the following functionalities:
1. **Add Person**: Create a new user in the social network.
2. **Add Friendship**: Establish a connection between two users, representing a mutual friendship.
3. **Display Network**: View the entire social network as an adjacency list, showing all connections.
4. **Display Friends**: List all direct friends of a specified user.
5. **Suggest Friends**: Recommend new friends for a user by analyzing second-degree connections (friends of friends).

## Purpose and Impact
### Why was this application created?
This application was designed as a learning tool to:
- **Demonstrate graph data structures**: Show how graphs can represent complex relationships like social networks.
- **Provide practical programming experience**: Offer a hands-on way to understand and implement abstract computer science concepts.
- **Explore real-world scenarios**: Simulate social interactions to make learning more relatable and engaging.

### How does it help the community?
The **Social Network Graph Application** benefits both learners and the community by:
- **Educational Value**: Helping students and beginners understand graph theory and its applications in an interactive way.
- **Inspiration for Development**: Serving as a foundation for more advanced systems, such as social networking sites or recommendation systems.
- **Encouraging Connectivity**: Simulating how technology can enhance connections and suggest relationships, fostering ideas for real-world applications.

This application bridges theoretical knowledge and practical skills, empowering learners and inspiring developers to build meaningful tools for real-world challenges.
